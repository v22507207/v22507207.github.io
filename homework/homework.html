                                BETHEL PARK, Pa. - The nation reeled Sunday from the shocking news that a 20-year-old gunman had attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a political rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday evening, a brazen act of political violence the likes of which America has not seen since an attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life 43 years ago.
                                • Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was recovering after he was injured in the right ear when a sniper opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle from a rooftop about 400 feet outside a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One spectator was killed and two others were “critically injured,” the Secret Service said.
